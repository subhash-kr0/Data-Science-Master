    "## Q1: Key Features of the Wine Quality Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The wine quality dataset contains several features that are crucial for predicting the quality of wine. These features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fixed Acidity:** Affects the tartness and freshness of wine.\n",
    "- **Volatile Acidity:** High levels can lead to an unpleasant vinegar taste.\n",
    "- **Citric Acid:** Adds freshness and flavor to wines.\n",
    "- **Residual Sugar:** Higher residual sugar can enhance the sweetness of wine.\n",
    "- **Chlorides:** High chloride levels can give a salty taste.\n",
    "- **Free Sulfur Dioxide:** Prevents microbial growth and oxidation.\n",
    "- **Total Sulfur Dioxide:** Combination of free and bound forms, acts as a preservative.\n",
    "- **Density:** Correlates with alcohol content and sugar levels.\n",
    "- **pH:** Influences the taste, stability, and color of the wine.\n",
    "- **Sulphates:** Contributes to wine's flavor and acts as an antioxidant.\n",
    "- **Alcohol:** Higher alcohol content generally improves quality ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these features can have a significant impact on the quality of wine. Understanding their roles can help in predicting wine quality accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q2: Handling Missing Data in the Wine Quality Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "During the feature engineering process, handling missing data is crucial. Common imputation techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean Imputation:** Replacing missing values with the mean of the column.\n",
    "  - **Advantages:** Simple to implement, preserves mean of the dataset.\n",
    "  - **Disadvantages:** Does not account for the distribution of the data, can distort correlations.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Median Imputation:** Replacing missing values with the median of the column.\n",
    "  - **Advantages:** Robust to outliers.\n",
    "  - **Disadvantages:** May not be suitable for skewed distributions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Mode Imputation:** Replacing missing values with the mode of the column.\n",
    "  - **Advantages:** Useful for categorical data.\n",
    "  - **Disadvantages:** Can create a bias if the mode is not representative.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **K-Nearest Neighbors Imputation:** Using the average value of the k-nearest neighbors.\n",
    "  - **Advantages:** Considers the correlation structure of the data.\n",
    "  - **Disadvantages:** Computationally intensive, sensitive to the choice of k.\n",

    "##  Q3: Key Factors Affecting Students' Performance Key factors include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Study Time: Amount of time spent studying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parental Education: Parents' level of education.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attendance: Attendance record of the student.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extracurricular Activities: Participation in activities outside of academics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Health: Overall health and well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "Socioeconomic Status: Family's economic background.\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze these factors, use statistical techniques such as correlation analysis, regression analysis, and hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify the distribution of each feature, perform EDA using visualizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Histogram:** For each feature to see the distribution.\n",
    "- **Boxplot:** To identify outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
