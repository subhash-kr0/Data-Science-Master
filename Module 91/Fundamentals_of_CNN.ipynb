        "2. **Examples**:\n",

        "**Activation Functions**: Activation functions (e.g., ReLU) introduce non-linearity into the model, enabling CNNs to capture complex relationships within the data.\n",
        "<br>Example: Activation functions help detect the presence of features and patterns more effectively.\n",

        "<br>Example: In image classification, the softmax layer assigns probabilities to different object classes.\n",
