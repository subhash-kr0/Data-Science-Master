    "1. **Independence of Observations:** The data collected from different groups should be independent of each other.\n",
    "   - *Violation Example:* If the data from different groups are related or influenced by the same factors, the independence assumption is violated.\n",
    "2. **Normality:** The data within each group should be approximately normally distributed.\n",
    "   - *Violation Example:* If the data are heavily skewed or have outliers, the normality assumption is violated.\n",
    "3. **Homogeneity of Variances (Homoscedasticity):** The variances among the groups should be approximately equal.\n",
    "   - *Violation Example:* If one group has much larger variance compared to others, the homogeneity of variances assumption is violated.\n",
    "4. **Random Sampling:** The samples should be randomly selected from the population.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Partitioning of Variance:**\n",
    "ANOVA works by partitioning the total variability in the data into components attributable to different sources of variation. The main components are:\n",
    "- **Total Sum of Squares (SST):** Total variability in the data.\n",
    "- **Between-Group Sum of Squares (SSB):** Variability due to differences between the groups.\n",
    "- **Within-Group Sum of Squares (SSW):** Variability within each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importance:**\n",
    "Understanding the partitioning of variance helps in determining how much of the total variability is explained by the differences between the groups and how much is due to random error or within-group variability. It is crucial for interpreting the results of an ANOVA test.\n"
