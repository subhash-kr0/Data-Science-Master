    "   - Guido van Rossum\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Which type of Programming does Python support?**\n",
    "   - Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?**\n",
    "   - Yes, Python is case sensitive.\n",

    "   - .py\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Is Python code compiled or interpreted?**\n",
    "   - Python code is interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language?**\n",
    "   - Functions, classes, loops, conditional statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **State a character used to give single-line comments in Python?**\n",
    "   - `#`\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Mention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on?**\n",
    "   - `sys.version`, `sys.version_info`, `platform.python_version()`\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called**\n",
    "   - `lambda`\n",
