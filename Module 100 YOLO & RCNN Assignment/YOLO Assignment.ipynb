        "The Complete Intersection over Union (CIOU) loss function plays a significant role in YOLOv4 by improving object detection accuracy. CIOU loss is a modification of the traditional Intersection over Union (IoU) loss and it addresses some of the limitations of the IoU loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Better Localization:** CIOU loss takes into account both the overlap between predicted bounding boxes and ground truth boxes (IoU) and the distance between their centers. This means that CIOU loss encourages the model to not only make accurate size predictions but also to position the bounding boxes more precisely.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Reduced Localization Error:** By considering the distance between centers, CIOU loss penalizes cases where the predicted box is not well-centered on the ground truth object. This reduces localization errors, especially for objects that are not perfectly aligned with the grid cells in the detection process.\n",
