        "\n",
        "a) **Region Proposal**:\n",
        "   - In the region proposal phase, potential object regions or bounding boxes in an image are generated. In the original R-CNN, this was typically done using methods like Selective Search or EdgeBoxes. These proposed regions serve as candidates for objects in the image.\n",
        "\n",
        "b) **Warping and Resizing**:\n",
        "   - After region proposal, the regions are cropped from the image and warped to a fixed size (e.g., 224 x 224 pixels) to ensure consistency for further processing. This warping and resizing step prepares the proposed regions for input into a CNN.\n",
        "\n",
        "c) **Pretrained CNN Architecture**:\n",
        "   - R-CNN uses a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a feature extractor. Common choices include AlexNet, VGG, or other architectures. The CNN processes the warped and resized region proposals to extract feature vectors that represent the content of each region.\n",
        "\n",
        "d) **Pretrained SVM models**:\n",
        "   - Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are trained on the extracted CNN features to classify the contents of each region proposal into different object categories (e.g., dog, car, person). R-CNN uses a separate SVM for each category, and these SVM models are pretrained on a labeled dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "e) **Cleanup**:\n",

The region proposals with high confidence scores are considered as positive detections for a specific object category.\n",
        "\n",

Non-maximum suppression and bounding box refinement are additional steps to improve the accuracy of object localization and reduce duplicate detections."

Boxes that have a significant overlap (intersection over union, IoU) with the selected box are removed. The IoU is a measure of how much two bounding boxes overlap. If the IoU is above a certain threshold (commonly 0.5), the box is considered redundant and is removed.\n",
