    "Some common activation functions used in neural networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Step Function:** The step function was one of the earliest activation functions used in ANNs. It outputs a binary value (0 or 1) based on whether the weighted sum of inputs is above or below a certain threshold. However, it is rarely used in modern networks due to its lack of differentiability, which makes it unsuitable for gradient-based optimization algorithms like backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sigmoid Function:** The sigmoid function, also known as the logistic function, outputs values in the range (0, 1). It squashes the input values to the interval [0, 1]. Sigmoid functions are differentiable, making them suitable for gradient-based optimization. However, they suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, especially for deep networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hyperbolic Tangent (Tanh) Function:** The tanh function is similar to the sigmoid but outputs values in the range (-1, 1), which makes it zero-centered. Like the sigmoid, it is differentiable and suitable for training deep networks. However, it still suffers from the vanishing gradient problem to some extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU):** ReLU is one of the most popular activation functions in deep learning. It computes the output as max(0, x). ReLU is computationally efficient and helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. However, it has a problem known as the \"dying ReLU\" problem, where neurons can become inactive and never activate again during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Leaky ReLU:** Leaky ReLU is a variant of ReLU that addresses the dying ReLU problem by allowing a small gradient when the input(x) is negative. It computes the output as max(α * x, x), where α is a small positive constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Parametric ReLU (PReLU):** PReLU is another variant of ReLU where the slope for negative inputs is learned during training instead of being a fixed value. This makes it more flexible than Leaky ReLU.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Softmax:** It is a special case of activation function used for multiclass classification.It is a generalised form of sigmoid function.Here we take a vector of values and squash it in range of 0 to 1 such that the sum of all the squashed vector values is 1."

    "- **Input-Output Mapping:** The sigmoid function takes an input value, x, and maps it to an output value, σ(x), in the range (0, 1). This mapping is useful for problems where the goal is to produce a binary output or estimate probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **S-Shaped Curve:** The sigmoid function's graph resembles an S-shaped curve, which means that for inputs close to zero, it outputs values close to 0.5, and as the input moves away from zero in either direction, the output approaches either 0 or 1. This property allows it to introduce non-linearity into the neural network.\n",

    "**Disadvantages of the Sigmoid Activation Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vanishing Gradient:** Sigmoid suffers from the vanishing gradient problem, especially in deep neural networks. As the input moves far from zero, the gradient of the sigmoid becomes extremely small, causing issues during backpropagation. This can slow down or impede training, particularly in deep networks.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Output Saturation:** When the input to the sigmoid is very positive or very negative, the function saturates, meaning that the output becomes very close to 0 or 1. In this regime, the gradient of the sigmoid is almost zero, causing slow convergence during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Less Effective for Deep Networks:** Due to the vanishing gradient problem, the sigmoid function is less popular in deep neural networks compared to the rectified linear unit (ReLU) and its variants, which are more efficient at training deep architectures.\n",
